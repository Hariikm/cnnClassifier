    Here we are initialising the language environment as english, ( if we got a search bar, or any other chat bots and stuff like that )

    that our language is english and if we type in gift ( which means gift in english and poison in german) we are signifying
    Gift ( in enlgish ) and not tthe poison.

    The LC_ALL says that every other locale variables like LC_MONETARY ( $, â‚¬ ) we are using $ as the currency sign and not the euro as
    we are using en_US) , LC_COLLATE ( punctuations ), LC_TIME ( Time formats ) in english and not as other languages.
